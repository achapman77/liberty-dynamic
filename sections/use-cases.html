            <p>Minimal initial training required as the flashbang has similar deployment mechanics to current flashbangs. </p>
            <p>Liberty Dynamic's trainer is designed to the same form factor as the original.</p>
            <p>Economical reloadable training cartridges significantly reduce training costs and help improve operator proficiency.</p>

                <h4 class="mb-3">sUAS DEPLOYMENT</h4>
                <p>Liberty Dynamicâ€™s Smart Fuse Enhanced Flashbang has been adapted to be deployed by a compact delivery system affixed to a sUAS (aerial drone). </p>
                <p>The compact delivery system does not drop the flashbang from the sUAS. Rather, the energetic event is propagated in a directional cone from the undercarriage.</p> 
                <p>Irritants, dye, and rubber BBs are optional payloads.</p>
                <p>The compact delivery system is designed to adapt to currently fielded sUAS technology. There is no need for the customer to buy a new sUAS platform.</p>
