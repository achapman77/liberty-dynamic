        <h4 class="text-uppercase text-center">Superior Safety</h4>
        <p>Ports located at bottom of device direct a powerful <span class="text-primary">external noise-flash event</span>.</p>
        <p>Since the noise-flash event occurs in free space well above the ground, this virtually <span class="text-primary">eliminates the risk of secondary fragmentation</span> from debris.</p>
        <p>The binary energetic material contained within the device allows for <span class="text-primary">drastically lowered volatility levels</span>, creating a vastly safer and more reliable device.</p>
        <p>  The device has an <span class="text-primary">ultra-low fire & smoke hazard</span> due to the efficient burn of the energetic material and the device <span class="text-primary">remains cool to the touch</span>. </p>
        <p>Any failure upon deployment and device renders safe in 60 seconds.</p>

        <h4 class="text-uppercase text-center">Superior Design</h4>
        <p>Deployment mechanics match existing DD devices, therefore <span class="text-primary">minimal training will be required</span>.</p>
        <p>A digital "smart" fuse improves operational control through increased adaptability and a <span class="text-primary">zero-time delay deviation</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="text-primary">The smart fuse can be factory programmed to any delay length</span>.</p>
        <p>Emitting a powerful and disorienting report, the deviceâ€™s energetic sound and light output surpasses industry standards.  <span class="text-primary">The output is also factory scalable to specification (Tested to 184db)</span>.</p>
        <p>Semi-flat ergonomic design promotes <span class="text-primary">improved target accuracy</span> as the unit does not roll after deployment.</p>
        <p><span class="text-primary">LED indicator lights provide device condition feedback</span>.</p>
        <!-- <p>It also has a slimmer profile while being carried, enhancing freedom of movement.</p> -->

        <h4 class="text-uppercase text-center">Superior Efficiency</h4>
        <p>Liberty Dynamic's Device & Training <span class="text-primary">units are reloadable</span>, thereby reducing overall operating costs.</p>
        <p>Safe and inexpensive reloadable training cartridges enable personnel to <span class="text-primary">be more adequately trained while still maximizing cost-effectiveness</span>.</p>
        <p>Most importantly, the low volatility energetic material and very low fragmentation potential should  <span class="text-primary">reduce costly lawsuits and insurance claims</span> resulting from improperly deployed or flawed devices.</p>
        <p>Liberty Dynamic is aggressively seeking a classification that will simplify shipping and storage requirements. </p>
