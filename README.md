## Overview
Liberty Dynamic has engineered a Smarter, Safer, & Superior Flashbang that eliminates the hazards of existing flash-bang design while also enabling new opportunites for deployment.  The company is on a rocketship trajectory with HUGE interest from DOD and Law Enforcement agencies around the globe.

## Site Design
The site is built off an existing Bootstrap template with some unique customizations.  
For instance, I custom-programmed the drop-down team bios, rearranged and added sections, and improved the NavBar.  
The site is also fully kitted with Google Analytics triggers that measure all aspects of user engagement.
